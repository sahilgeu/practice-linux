INODE- store metadata of a file - who created the file, when file was creted
df -i shows inodes related to a file system
ls -li show inode related to a file
ls -lia for hidden files
Hard and soft links- used to create reference to a file(mechanism by which we can access a file)
Hard link - basically increases reference count of a file, inode no and permission are same for both the links also a change in one file will reflect change in the link and deleting any file will not have any effect on either
How to creae hard link- ln original file new file
Soft Link-acts as a shortcut, inoode,permission all are different also a change in one file will reflect change in the link and if we delete the original file soft link will not work
How to create soft link- ln -s original file new file
